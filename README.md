# Lejdborg's dotfiles

These are my system configurations. There's not much there at the
moment, but this new structure will make it easier for me to share my
configs between home and work, which will lead to me adding more stuff
over time.

Use it if you find anything you like, but chances are no one but me will
be the very least interested. But hey, at least it'll make life easier for
me.

## install

I stole the basic setup from [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s
[dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), including his excellent rake
script that makes installation very painless.

* `git clone git://github.com/Lejdborg/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
* `cd ~/.dotfiles`
* `rake install`
